# Introduction

This is my personal package. It contains some handy functions that I find useful
for my projects.

# Colours

Sometimes you want to generate shades of a colour. The `make_shades()` function
makes this easy!

```{r} 
shades <- make_shades("goldenrod", 5)
```

If you want to see what the shades look like you can plot them using
`plot_colours()`.

```{r} 
plot_colours(shades)
```

This function is also useful for viewing any other palettes.

```{r} 
plot_colours(rainbow(5))
```
